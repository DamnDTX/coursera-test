# PART 1 - Why not keep things simple


## Summary: Easir to deal with code:
 ° Good code organization;
 ° Updating part of it shouldn't affect other parts;
 ° Update functionality without a re-write of large portions of your code;
 ° Code Reuse; 
 ° Code should be fairly easy to test. (When we say this, we´re talking about making peaces of code that can be tested independently, even if in the end everything will be conected);


## PART 2 - Why Does Code Get Complex? 
° Hard to read code
 - Bad or inconsistent coding style
 - Hard to read variable  & function names
 - No comments or API documentation
° **Lack of High Cohesion & Low Coupling**
